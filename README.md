# Periodic Table of Elements (AngularJS)
This is a side project that I'm doing in order to learn AngularJS. This application gets element data from a JSON file in a factory that is manipulated via a controller. I love science and need to learn Angular for work so...alas, the PTOE.

Feel free to fork and submit pull request with any improvements that you see fit.
