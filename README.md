# Periodic Table of Elements (AngularJS)
This is a side project that I'm doing in order to learn AngularJS. This application gets element data from a JSON file in a factory that is manipulated via a controller. I love science and need to learn Angular for work so...alas, the PTOE.

When finished, this will will add electrons and paths to an atom. See my [Pen](http://codepen.io/daveberning/pen/ZezVVd).
